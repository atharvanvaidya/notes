```
- Archive is going to be deb (Regular Binary) or deb-src (Source), depending if you want a package or the source of the package.
- Mirror should be http.kali.org/kali as this is our load balancer, which will direct you to best mirror.
- Branch is what version of Kali you wish to use.
- Component is what packages you wish to use, based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG). Kali defaults to everything.
